# Live Demo — Created During the Presentation

This folder contains code that was created **live during the presentation** as a demonstration of agentic engineering in action.

See the full presentation: [presentation.pdf](../slides/presentation.pdf)

## What happened here

During the talk, the audience watched Claude Code generate a working HU-Drop game variant in real time — from a single prompt, with no manual coding. The result is what you see in this folder.

Two variants were generated live:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `claude/` | Generated live with Claude Code during the presentation |
| `codex/` | Generated live with Codex during the presentation |

## The Game

HU-Drop is a simple word-clicking game. Words from HU Berlin fall from the top of the screen and the player clicks them before they reach the bottom.

The same prompt was used as for the pre-generated variants in the repository root (`/claude`, `/gemini`, `/codex`). The live generation shows how quickly a working game can be produced — and illustrates both the power and the risks of vibe coding.

## Context

This demo was part of a presentation on **Agentic Engineering** — the disciplined use of AI agents in software development — contrasted with **Vibe Coding**, where code is generated from prompts without review or understanding.

> "Vibe coding is when you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."
